## Hi, I'm Jon! ðŸ‘‹

I'm a self-taught programmer who knows that that really means I'm a community-taught programmer.
I run the [Data Science Learning Community](https://DSLC.io) as my way of giving back and helping make sure everyone has a chance to learn.

I particularly love programming in the [R programming language](https://www.r-project.org/), although I also dabble in [JavaScript](https://ecma-international.org/publications-and-standards/standards/ecma-262/) (mostly for [Shiny](https://shiny.posit.co/r) apps).
I get paid to apply those passions as a Principal Data Solutions Engineer at [Atorus Research](https://www.atorusresearch.com/).

I live in Austin, Texas, with my spouse, two children, and two large dogs.
